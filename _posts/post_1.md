Here is a Medium blogpot co-authored with Matteo Caorsi on brain artery trees analysis using TDA. The work was part of the giotto-tda challenge 2020 for the best usecase of topology of the year and won a joint second place. You can find the blogpost [here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-brain-artery-trees-with-giotto-tda-688a44c00f59) .The code can be found [here.](https://github.com/rorondre/gtda-challenge-2020) . A few people had already contacted me about the pre-processed dataset, which is available upon request.
