I am a second year PhD student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh supervised by [Dr. Rik Sarkar](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/). I am part of the [ANGLE lab](https://angle-lab.com/) and the [Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Biomedical AI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai). I am exploring interesting applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and geometry to biomedical data and machine learning.

Currently I am doing a research visit at Helmholtz Zentrum Munich at [Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me/) 's [AIDOS group](https://aidos.group/).

In my free time I like drinking coffee, eating spicy food, all sorts of exercise (cycling, walking, hiking) and board games (Hanabi, Set and Jungle Speed in particular).
