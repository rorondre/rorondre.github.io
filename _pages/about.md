I am currently a second year PhD student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh supervised by Dr. Rik Sarkar and Dr. Miguel Bernabeu. I am part of the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Biomedical AI. My core area of study is applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to biomedical data and machine learning.
