I am currently a second year PhD student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh supervised by [Dr. Rik Sarkar](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) and [Dr. Miguel Bernabeu](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/miguel-o-bernabeu). I am part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Biomedical AI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai). My core area of study is applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to biomedical data and machine learning.
