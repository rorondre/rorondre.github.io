I am currently a second year PhD student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh supervised by [Dr. Rik Sarkar](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/). I am part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Biomedical AI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai). I am looking for interesting applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to biomedical data and machine learning.

In my free time I like drinking coffee, eating spicy food, all sorts of exercise (cycling, walking, tennis and table tennis are top of the list) and board games (Hanabi, Set and Jungle Speed in particular).
