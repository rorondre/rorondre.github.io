- May 2021: Will be attending LOGML summer school in July 2021
- March 2021: Extended abstract on 'A geometric approach to papillae identification in 3D meshes.' was accepted at YRF at SoCG 2021
- November 2020: Won joint second place at Giotto-TDA Challenge 2020 with a notebook on ''Exploring brain artery trees with Giotto-tda''. The purpose of this challenge is to create the best use-case of applied topology of the year. The code can be found [here.](https://github.com/rorondre/gtda-challenge-2020/blob/master/rorondre/Exploring_brain_artery_trees_and_age_with_giotto_tda.ipynb) The pre-processed dataset is available upon request. I co-authored a [blogpost](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-brain-artery-trees-with-giotto-tda-688a44c00f59) in Medium on the topic.
- July 2020: 2 papers accepted at the International Workshop on Ophthalmic Medical Image Analysis, part of MICCAI 2020 ('A framework for the discovery of retinal biomarkers in Optical Coherence Tomography
Angiography (OCTA)' and 'DR detection using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA): A transfer learning approach with robustness analysis')
