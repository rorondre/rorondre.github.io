News:

- New preprint on 'Differentially private shapley values for data evaluation' is out on arXiv!
- Our paper 'Euler characteristic surfaces' was accepted at Foundations of Data Science, AIMS journal as part of the special issue on 'Topological methods in data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence'! 
- Our paper on 'Topological detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease using Betti curves.' was accepted at the 1st Topological Data Analysis and Its Applications for Medical Data workshop at MICCAI 2021
- Will be attending LOGML summer school in July 2021!
- Extended abstract on 'A geometric approach to papillae identification in 3D meshes.' was accepted at YRF at SoCG 2021
- Won joint second place at Giotto-TDA Challenge 2020, The purpose of this challenge is to create the best use-case of applied topology of the year. The code can be found [here.](https://github.com/rorondre/gtda-challenge-2020) . The pre-processed dataset is available upon request. I co-authored a [blogpost](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-brain-artery-trees-with-giotto-tda-688a44c00f59) in Medium on the topic.
- 2 papers accepted at the International Workshop on Ophthalmic Medical Image Analysis, part of MICCAI 2020 ('A framework for the discovery of retinal biomarkers in Optical Coherence Tomography
Angiography (OCTA)' and 'DR detection using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA): A transfer learning approach with robustness analysis')
